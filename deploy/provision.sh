 Provisioning done.

 Certificates: Caddy requests them on the first HTTPS request and
 renews them automatically. Nothing to schedule.

 Add these three GitHub Actions secrets to malinborn/mdmini:

   DEPLOY_HOST = $(curl -s4 --max-time 5 ifconfig.me || echo '<this server IP>')
   DEPLOY_USER = ${DEPLOY_USER}
   DEPLOY_SSH_KEY = the private key below (including BEGIN/END lines)

 Set the key without it passing through anyone's chat history:
