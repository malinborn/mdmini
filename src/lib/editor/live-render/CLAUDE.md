# live-render — the permanently-hidden-markup editor mode

Markdown markers stay hidden while the caret is on the element, Notion-style.
This directory holds only what is specific to that mode; the rendering itself
is the shared decoration layer in `../preview/`.

Read `../preview/CLAUDE.md` first for the decoration rules and the reveal
policy — this file assumes them.

## How it is installed

`liveRenderExtensions()` (`index.ts`) is added to `previewCompartment`
(`../setup.ts:67`) by the effect in `App.svelte`, **only** while the selected
engine is `live-render`. In live-preview none of it is in the editor state at
all, which is what makes the existing mode safe by construction rather than by
review discipline.

The flavour facet decides whether markup is *revealed*; this bundle decides how
*editing* behaves. They are separate and both are needed.

| File | Concern |
|------|---------|
| `index.ts` | The bundle, and the only place precedence is documented for callers |
| `atomic.ts` | Hidden marker ranges, `EditorView.atomicRanges`, the caret transaction filter |
| `block-format.ts` | Backspace at block start strips heading / list / quote formatting |
| `inline-continuation.ts` | Typing at a span boundary continues the format; `isLiveRenderActive` |
| `heading-input.ts` | Supplies the space that makes a `#` run a heading |
| `format-commands.ts` | Tree-aware inline toggles used by both the toolbar and the shortcuts |
| `selection-toolbar.ts` | Floating inline-format toolbar |
| `inspector.ts` / `inspector-model.ts` | Link URL and fenced-code language |
| `effects.ts` | `openInspectorFor`, the toolbar → inspector handoff |

## Gotchas

### Atomicity is two mechanisms, and the second one is not optional

`EditorView.atomicRanges` is consulted **only** by the caret-motion helpers
(`moveByChar`, `moveByGroup`, `moveVertically`), by `MouseSelection`, by
`applyDOMChange` when `userEvent == "select.pointer"`, and by `deleteBy` via
`skipAtomic`. There is no transaction filter anywhere in `@codemirror/view`.

So any programmatic `dispatch({selection})` walks straight into a hidden
marker, and the next keystroke writes corrupt source. This app already has five
such callers: `@codemirror/search`, session restore in `App.svelte`, `history()`
restoring a selection on undo, `../preview/table-selection.ts`, and the
slash-command / hover-menu insertions. `caretNormalizeFilter`
(`atomic.ts:333`) is what covers them.

The filter consults the same `RangeSet` as the atomic provider rather than
resolving the node at a point. `decorateLink` hides `](url)` as one span wider
than any `LinkMark`, so a caret inside the URL text resolves to a `URL` node
that no list of marker names would catch.

### `hiddenMarkRanges` and `plugin.ts` must agree, exactly

`hiddenMarkRanges` (`atomic.ts:253`) deliberately mirrors the traversal in
`../preview/plugin.ts` — same switch, same descend-or-`return false`. Change one
and you must change the other.

Both failure directions are bad, and both are quiet:

- **Hidden but not atomic** — the caret walks into text that is not drawn, and
  typing lands somewhere the user cannot see.
- **Atomic but not hidden** — the caret refuses to enter text that is plainly
  visible on screen.

Concrete cases that live in this seam: fenced-code fences are hidden with a
zero-height *line* decoration, not a replace, so the text is really there and
must **not** be atomic; the ordered-list marker is never replaced by any
decorator; table cell contents are rendered by a separate path entirely.

### Backspace needs `Prec.highest`; Escape only needs `Prec.high`

Backspace appears in the view's `PendingKeys` table paired with
`inputType: "deleteContentBackward"`. On a contenteditable it is therefore not
resolved from `keydown` alone: the native edit is allowed to land and is
reconciled afterwards, with the key re-dispatched so bindings still get a turn.

At `Prec.high` the block-format command was **never entered**, and the failure
was not a clean fall-through — the DOM-derived change was applied instead.
With the bullet rendered as a widget, that reconciliation rewrote `- b` as
`  b`: a silent outdent, text still inside the list item. Every unit test passed
throughout, because they call the pure function directly.

Escape carries no `inputType` and works fine at `Prec.high`. Do not "simplify"
the two to match.

Both keymaps carry their precedence at the source so a caller cannot forget it.
The main keymap is registered at `../setup.ts:55`, before the compartment at
`:67`, and CM6 tries equal-precedence handlers in registration order.

### The caret boundary paints two offsets at one pixel

For `**bold**`, offset 6 (before the closing marker) and offset 8 (after it)
render at the same screen position, because the markers are zero-width and
absent from the DOM. Typing at 6 lands inside the bold, at 8 outside.

This is why the mode has **one canonical caret position** — the filter
normalises outward — and why an `inputHandler` redirects insertion back inside.
It is also why **the arrow keys are not an exit**: at that boundary an arrow
press moves the caret two offsets and zero pixels, which is indistinguishable
from a dead key. At end of line there is nowhere for it to go at all.

Exit is Escape or the Cmd+B family, and a state field remembers the suppressed
boundary so a second keystroke still lands outside. If you add another exit
gesture, it goes through that field.

### `keybindings.ts` is shared with live-preview

`Mod-b` / `Mod-i` / `Mod-Shift-x` live in `../keybindings.ts`, which both modes
use. Anything mode-specific there must be gated on
`isLiveRenderActive(state)` (`inline-continuation.ts`) — it checks for a state
field only this bundle installs.

Swallowing a key unconditionally, or picking a different command, changes
live-preview. `keybindings.ts:70` is the gate; `continuationFormatExitSpec`
has the same guard for the same reason.

### Emphasis is `*`, never `_`

CommonMark's flanking rules stop `_` from opening or closing emphasis inside a
word. A `_`-wrapped partial word produced no `Emphasis` node at all, so the
unwrap path found nothing to remove and every further click wrapped again —
`_x_`, then `__x__`, which is *strong*, not emphasis. It also has to match what
`Mod-i` inserts, or the toolbar and the shortcut disagree.

### Never use a text heuristic to toggle inline formatting

`toggleWrap` in `../keybindings.ts` compares the characters around the
selection. With `hello` selected inside `**hello**` it sees one asterisk on
each side, reads that as already-wrapped, and strips one from each — bold
becomes italic. The reverse order does not trip the same test, which is what
made the bug look arbitrary.

`format-commands.ts` consults the syntax tree instead and removes a span by
deleting its mark children. Use it. `toggleWrap` stays only because
live-preview depends on its current behaviour.

Note that Lezer names the markers of *both* `Emphasis` and `StrongEmphasis`
`EmphasisMark` — the difference is the mark's text length. Match on the node
name, not the mark name.

### The toolbar and the inspector need opposite focus rules

The toolbar's buttons use `mousedown` with `preventDefault()`, so DOM focus
never leaves the editor and the selection survives the click. The inspector's
input **must** take real focus — that is the whole point of it being reachable
by keyboard — so `view.hasFocus` cannot be a close signal there.

The toolbar's outside-click handler must ignore clicks **inside the editor**.
A drag-select fires `selectionSet` on `mousemove`, so the listener is armed
before `mouseup`, and the trailing click of the drag was closing the toolbar on
the very selection that opened it. Deferring registration by a macrotask does
not help. Clicks inside the editor are already governed by the selection: the
plugin hides the toolbar when the selection collapses.

### A task item is `Task`, not `Link`

The design doc claimed `- [x] done` collides with link parsing. It does not:
`markdownLanguage` already bundles GFM, so it parses as `Task > TaskMarker` and
never reaches a `Link` node.

The real lookalike is `- [x](url) text`. `TaskList.parseBlock` requires
whitespace after the bracket, so that parses as a plain inline `Link`, while
`../preview/lists.ts` still draws a checkbox over it from a text-only regex —
which is why `atomic.ts` excludes it explicitly. That same regex is
case-**sensitive**: `[X]` renders no checkbox at all.

### Mermaid stays `'on-cursor'`

Reverting to the fenced source is the only way to edit a diagram. Hiding it
permanently would require a full nested editor in the inspector, which is out
of scope, so `LIVE_RENDER` pins mermaid to `'on-cursor'` and the inspector
skips mermaid fences rather than offering a redundant language picker.

## Known limitations

These are honest properties of the approach, not open bugs. Do not "fix" them
by re-introducing cursor-based reveal — that would undo the mode.

- **Search runs against the source.** `boldtext` inside `**bold**text` is
  unfindable, and searching `**` yields hits that are not rendered. A real fix
  needs a search index over the visible text.
- **Hiding markers moves the reflow rather than removing it.** A marker is only
  hidden once Lezer has a completed node, so while typing `**bol` you see raw
  text, and four characters vanish at once when the closing `*` lands.
- **Splitting an ordered list does not renumber.** The second list restarts at
  its own number.
- **IME is unverified.** There is a known CM6 Safari bug on exactly this
  configuration — a `Decoration.mark` containing several `Decoration.replace`,
  which is literally `../preview/inline.ts` — and Tauri on macOS is WKWebView.
  Marijn's patch does not close the case where a widget is added in front of
  the composition, which is what this mode does while typing.

## Testing

- `npx vitest run --dir src`. **Not** `npm run test` — it picks up stale copies
  under `.claude/worktrees/`.
- There is no jsdom in this project's vitest setup and no existing test builds
  a real `EditorView`. So every module here splits pure logic from the DOM or
  view layer, and the tests exercise the pure half: `computeBlockFormatRemoval`,
  `continuationRedirect`, `headingSpaceRedirect`, `detectInspectorTarget`,
  `hiddenMarkRanges`. Keep that split when adding behaviour.
- **Anything routed through a keymap or an inputHandler cannot be unit-tested
  here.** Both the `Prec` bug and the flavour-switch bug had green suites. Drive
  the real app.

### Driving the real app

`npm run dev:app` builds under a renamed identifier (`md-mini-dev`,
`com.md-mini.dev`) with its own data directory, so it cannot disturb an
installed release. It exposes the MCP bridge on port 9223 in debug builds.
Never use `npm run tauri dev` or `npm run tauri build` for this.

Three traps cost real time here:

1. **`document.hasFocus()`.** CM6's `view.hasFocus` is false whenever the OS
   window is not frontmost, no matter what you focus programmatically. Plugins
   that hide on blur — the toolbar — will therefore never appear while you
   probe from a background window. `view.plugins` and its constructor names are
   a reliable way to check a plugin is installed regardless of focus.
2. **Duplicate modules.** A dynamic `import('/src/…')` from the devtools can
   return a *different* module instance than the running app holds, so a
   `StateField` or `Facet` imported that way will not match the one in the
   state, and `state.field(f, false)` returns `undefined` for a field that is
   actually installed. Reading a facet's *value* out of the state is safe;
   asserting the absence of a field via an outside import is not.
3. **Vite module caching.** After editing a file, `import('…/index.ts?v=x')`
   re-fetches that module but its transitive imports stay cached. Reload the
   webview instead.
