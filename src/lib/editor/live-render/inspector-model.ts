/**
 * Element inspector — Phase 7 of live-render.
 *
 * Under the `'never'` reveal policy, markdown markers stay hidden and their
 * ranges become atomic (Phase 2), so a link's URL and a fenced code block's
 * language are unreachable by caret. The inspector panel (`inspector.ts`)
 * is the escape hatch; this module is its pure, view-free logic.
 *
 * Note on the checkbox/Link collision flagged during planning: with this
 * project's parser config (`markdownLanguage` base, which already bundles
 * GFM — see `@codemirror/lang-markdown`), `- [x] done` parses as a `Task`
 * node with a `TaskMarker`, NOT as a `Link`. Verified empirically against
 * the exact config in `setup.ts` (see report). So `detectInspectorTarget`
 * needs no special-case exclusion — walking up from a position inside
 * `[x]`/`[ ]` never passes through a `Link` node at all.
