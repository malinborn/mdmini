/**
 * Everything the live-render flavour adds on top of the shared decoration
 * layer. This bundle is only ever installed while that flavour is active —
 * in live-preview none of it is present in the editor state at all, which is
 * how the existing mode is guaranteed to behave exactly as before.
 *
 * Order matters in one place: `liveRenderAtomic` must come first, because the
 * keymaps and the input handler below all assume the caret has already been
 * normalised out of hidden marker ranges.
 *
 * Both keymaps here carry their own precedence at the source, and the two are
 * deliberately different: `inlineContinuation()`'s Escape is `Prec.high`,
 * while `blockFormatKeymap`'s Backspace needs `Prec.highest` — verified
 * against a real keypress, `Prec.high` never reaches it, because Backspace is
 * resolved through the view's PendingKeys / beforeinput path rather than from
 * keydown alone. See the comment on `blockFormatKeymap`.
