//! `mdmini watch` — a stream of events about new comments, meant to be handed
//! to a Claude Code Monitor: every line of stdout wakes the agent's live
//! session.
//!
//! Deliberately never touches the command socket. The source of truth is the
//! `.mdmini_comments_*.md` files, so delivery keeps working with the app
//! closed, and the scope is a directory tree — which happens to coincide with
//! the agent's cwd, so no scope logic of its own is needed.
//!
//! Flood control here is not an optimisation but a condition of working at
//! all: the harness stops a monitor that emits too much, and the agent is not
//! told. Hence exactly one line per thread becoming `open`.
